UnicodeIt Linux is a linux port of the UnicodeIt tool,first developed by Kyle Cranmer and Sven Kreiss for MacOS.
This code wraps the original tool, providing an interactive interface with it, in a similar manner to the MacOS implementation. A web version is also available at http://www.unicodeit.net.
